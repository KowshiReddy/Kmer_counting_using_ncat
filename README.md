# Real-Time K-mer Analysis with Spark Streaming

This project implements a **real-time K-mer counting application** using **Apache Spark Streaming**. The system processes streamed text data to generate K-mers, count their occurrences, and print results for each batch interval.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Real-Time Processing**: Utilizes Spark Streaming for batch-wise data analysis.
- **K-mer Generation**: Extracts overlapping substrings (K-mers) of a specified length.
- **Flexible Data Source**: Supports data streaming via `ncat` or a Python-based socket.
- **Customizable Settings**: Easily adjust the K-mer length, batch interval, and data generation frequency.
